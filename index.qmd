**This is the second site published regarding regeneration for the project POC3.**

The previous site covered the initial model exploration. 
Here, the initial steps have been refined and the model is being optimized. 
The input data has changed from the FIA's FVS Ready data to a custom translation of raw FIA data to FVS Ready format. The imputation yaImpute is still being used, but the focus has changed to running the data with regression 
instead of classification.
