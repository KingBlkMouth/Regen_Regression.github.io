**This is the second site published regarding regeneration for the project POC3.**

This site was started on 16Sept24 to share between POC3 project members.


The previous site covered the initial model exploration. 
Here, the initial steps have been refined and the model is being optimized. 
The input data has changed from the FIA's FVS Ready data to a custom translation of raw FIA data to FVS Ready format. 
The imputation package yaImpute is still being used, but 
the focus has changed to running the data with regression instead of classification.
